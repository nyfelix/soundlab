# Virtual Instruments

I spend an incredible amount of time browsing virtual instruments and synth presets. Yet, this process is not satisfying for me, probably because even with vendor option, the possibilities are overwhelming. You could argue that this process would be much simpler if you know what you are looking for. However I think digging for new sounds is a creative and inspiring process that might lead to completely new ideas. That's why I want to give this topic an extra section.

## Finding the Rights Sounds
Workflow:
1. Decided for LogicPro Sound or Native Instruments
2. Browse by style or instrument (don't forget to favour interesting sounds, that do not fit to the current project)
3. Find the right preset
4. Adjust the preset
5. If the new preset should be reused. Save as userpreset.

Use Kontakt 7 for best browsing in individual instruments and samples and Presets that are not stand alone synthesizers.
I use the favorite function (*), so I'm not loosing to much time with browsing and forgetting. Komplete Kontrol would allow to browse through all presets, but it's less clearly arranged and it does not open the standalone application to play with settings. Komplete Kontrol becomes interesting when you want to test combinations of instruments and effects. But usually I would to this in my DAW.

## Priority list for Deep Dive into Virtual Instruments

1. Find the right synth to create my own sounds
2. Learn more about sequencers
3. Learn more about drum machines
4. Learn more about samplers
5. Learn more about vocoders


## Find the right synth

Blow you find some experience with different virtual synths. All in all you can say that looking at all theses synths was a great way to learn more about synths (particular playing with reaktor was a very eye-opening experience). In parallel to testing all these virtual synths I also went to a music store to play with hardware synths.
Conclusion: I bought a hardware synth. Why? The sound quality, particularly the booming base, was crazy. But a lot more important: I was immediately in a creative mode and making music, far away form the screen. I can't explain it, but the hardware synth feels like an instrument, while virtual synths seem more like a rational programming environment.

## Sequencers

For people that grew up with electronic music this might be funny. But I did non know what a sequencer actually does. Here I like the new feature of my DAW that allows to create pattens (in live loops as well as in traditional tracks). For me sequencers will be a great tool to finally create my own rhythmic patterns instead of using a virtual drummer.

Next to the sequencer I finally understood the concept of non linear composing (In the language of logic pro: Live Loops). Which is also new to me, since learned music in a classical way. I will add more information about settings and my personal workflow here.

## Life Loops

I'm still waiting for my hardware synth to come so I have some time to prepare a new workflow. My idea is to play with the synth and my roland piano keys, not in front of the PC screen. But I also want to build up a stack of loops to create beat and ambiance. For that I see two options:
1. Using my Roland Loop-Station
2. Using Logic Life Loops on an iPad next to the Minilogue XD. 

Here's how I see life loops helping me. 
1. Prepare different beats to start the synth session
2. I think of using a fix cell length to make things simpler. So recording can also be timed to start with the next loop and end at cell length
3. I have to prepare enough tracks for the different synth elements (bass, percussion, pads, a lead, and maybe still use my guitar)
4. Let's see how it goes :-)
