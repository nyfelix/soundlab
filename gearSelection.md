# Gear Selection

Here I want to document my considerations for gear selection. As far as now I bought stuff sometimes without knowing what I buy (e.g. my first mixer and microphone), some gear I bought after long nights of watching Youtube reviews, and some gear I actually tested before I bought it. E.g. for my latest mic I had two variants for testing in my home studio and I decided against a condenser mic with tube preamp for a cheaper one - not because of the money, but becaus of the sound in the context of my studio room.

Once more: Listening and testing with your own ears and hands in your personal setup is essential.

So here's the docs for my next decisions, just to my own learning.

## Synth

I spent quite some time to learn waft a synth actually is and how they work with virtual synths (such as the free Moog Model 15 or the incredible and endless space of Reaktor). This was very helpful to learn, but I never got into a real creative mood with this. Probably of the overwhelming amount of possibilities, probably just because I'm not capable to focus on the piano keys and the computer at the same time without moving from the right half of my brain to the left halt... booohm creativity stumbles.

So that's way I decided to sooner or later go for a hardware synth. Today I went to a music store to explain my situation and test if I'll really be happier with hardware. And the answer is a clear YES. I could profit a lot from what I learned with software synths, bot with the hardware I was immediately playing and experimenting.  

So what should it be? Here are my requirements
- Cost should be no more then 1500 Euros
- I have a bit of a space problem. So it should preferably be small
- I want to use the synth mainly to create cool baselines and pads. I'm currently no looking to much for leads, but this could be interesting in future.
- For pads a polyphonic synth seems a better option 
- Less is more: Synth are an endless universe. But I want to produce music and love my strings and percussion instruments. So it should be simple enough to just switch it on and start creating something without years of experience. 
  
Considerations:
- I learned from the music store today, that you can use any Keyboard to also feed an analog synth. Since I do already have an e-Piano in my room, the size, number and quality of keys is not really i big issue for me. I have to doublecheck on this, since I heard something different at another music store.
- After reading and testing for a while I found two synths that look very interesting for me in the range of my budget: Moog Grandmother, or the Korg Minilogue XD. They are very different but I like the sound of both and they were both very intuitive in usage.
- Further reading confirm that the Minilogue is more universal and it's a polysynth where the Moog Grandmother is monophonic. They even seem to complement each other. So it could be a good idea to start with the cheaper Minilogue and see how it goes. If I happen to become a synth freak, I can still add the Grandmother at a later stage. 
- If I really can use the keyboard of my Roland Piano, the small and rather cheap keys of the Minilogue are not a problem. I could maybe even go for the pure module... but then again I might be traveling and probably still like the keys.
- HAving said that: here are my next tasks:
    1. Make sure I can really use my Roland as Input devices. ** Result: Most synths I found, also the analog models, take Midi as input. Some also line (e.g. an electric guitar) an of course CV **
    2. Look for MOdule alternatives to the Minilogue XD. E.g. Novation Peak
   
Here's the final list of candidates in my area of investment:
- Polyphonic: Minilogue XD module, Novation Peak
- Monophonic: Mood Grandmother, Behringer Model D (module)
  
Conclusion: Although it would be so cool to have a Moog at home, the cheaper Minilogue XD will meet my requirements better, and as a module even save some space.
