# Production Workflow

This is my simple checklist for my production workflow including songwriting. I'm an amateur "I hide in the studio and do it all on my own" guy, That's why I include the songwriting/composition into my workflow. Quite often I will jump back from the production phase to the songwriting phase, if something does not work or if a "cool" verse turns out to be awful once listening to it after recording. Thus, what seems like a sequential workflow is more like a checklist where you can jump back and forth.

## Overview
I see the production workflow in 4 phases (based on many articles and some books I read)

1. Phase 1: Prepare a song (songwriting / composing)
   1.  Setting a theme
   2. Find the harmonics and rhythm
   3. Write the song
2. Phase 2: Production
   1. Prepare the project in the DAW
   2. Setting the rhythm (drums)
      Repeat 3, 4, and 5 for each track (analog or digital instruments):
   3. Recording
   4. Editing
     * track selection / cutting (comping)
     * Strip silence sections (logic: ctrl-x)
     * gain control
     * pitch editing
     * rhythm editing
     * removing quite sections
   5. Mixing
   6. Arranging 
     * panning (orchestra layout)
     * reverb (distance)
     * overall mixing and automation
  3. Phase 3: Mastering
  4. Phase 4: Release

## Phase 1: Prepare a song (songwriting / composing)

1. **Setting a Theme**. As most artists out there I think a song needs a theme and build around it. Sometimes the theme is based on a phrase of lyrics, or something I want to express a thought with words such as "I want to say thank you to my brothers and sisters". But quite often the theme is based on music a cord progression or melody. Then of course to write the lyrics around it can be a hard task. Im most cases my ideas pop up when I'm just fooling around with my guitar or piano. Or I catch up some melody element in the radio I want to further develop. I started to look for new inspiration everywhere and once you found something, you have to catch and hold it. That's why I think it's important to always have a recording app near by. I have a rather long list of awfully sung ideas (I'm not a good singer)j or guitar samples with friends talking in the background. When I lack an idea I go through that list and usually find something to work with. No and then I also delete stuff I don't like after a while to cerate space for new ideas.
  
2. **Find the harmonics and rhythm**. I'm not a professional musician, so don't think its to to explain how to write a song. However, in my case this is a process that is not really controlled. Usually I sit with the guitar or the piano and try until I find a way to match words, rhythm, a basic melody and harmonics. Interesting enough, things turn out to be quite different if I approach a song with guitar than on the piano. In some rare cases I also started with electronic instruments (synth pads or drum machine). I try as long as I have found a verse and a chorus.

3. **Write the song**. Having a rough idea of verse and chorus I then start to figure out how many verses I need to tell the story. Usually, based on that consideration I choose the song pattern. Then it's time to write the full text and very often the option to add a transition to the song pattern helps me to either point out an important part of the main message that does not fit into to tag line or still say the sing that does not fit into the verse. I'm not sure if this is good practices, but it turned out to be helpful for me. 

At the end of these steps I usually have a clear concept of the song:
* pattern
* text
* basic idea of rhythm and speed
* harmonics
* some of the melody elements
* often a very clear idea of the vocals

In some cases I also have a clear idea of the instruments to be used during production. But I try not to restrict myself, playing with different sounds during production is a big part of the fun, I thing. And it's normal that I go into a project with a guitar solo in mind and later on find out it's going to be a melodica, an organ, or an 80ties synth.

## Phase 2: Production
These steps are inspired by [1]

1. Prepare the project in the DAW
2. Setting the rhythm (drums)
   Repeat 3, 4, and 5 for each track (analog or digital instruments):
3. Recording
4. Editing
  * track selection / cutting
  * Strip silence sections (logic: ctrl-x)
  * gain control
  * pitch editing
  * rhythm editing
  * removing quite sections
5. Mixing
6. Arranging 
  * panning (orchestra layout)
  * reverb (distance)
  * overall mixing and automation

Here are some further thoughts about these steps:

1. **Prepare the project in the DAW**: *ToDo: Explain and give the link to the templates*
   
2. **Setting the rhythm**: I'm not a drummer, so im my case the drums come mostly from an electronic/sampled source. I learnt the hard way that you can fix many things on a later production stage, but not rhythm and speed. That's why I first choose the beat section, even if I record a cajon or percussion myself later on. So, at least for music in my genres, this is the first final decision I do in the production process.
   
3. **Recording**: I play several instruments, but all of them at a very average level. So in the first place I try to set my arrangements in a level that does not demand more than I can handle and still sounds good. Still recoding - in my case - remains a time consuming process. In very project I learn more about where to put the mics, how to handle analog gear, and at what level the preamp should be. To collect my experience and continuously improve I started this project. Test and my current settings to start with can be found [below](#recording-settings). Also, because I'm not a perfect musician, I will always take enough takes to later have good options for editing. As a rule of thumbs.
