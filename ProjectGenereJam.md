# 30 Seconds Challenge

This challenge is inspired by the "music production podcast" by Brian Funk. He is encouraging people to show up and get the work done until it's finished.

**Pick a genre and write a 30 seconds track in that gere every week**

The basic idea of this exercise is to go through the complete process of songwriting and production very quickly to build up experience and confidence. After each track I will do a short review and consider changes in my process or templates.
I also want to use the input form book "Music Production 2022+" by Tommy Swindali: He recommends to choose a reference track for each song.
It's not to goal to create great music this time, it's about learning and finishing with "good enough".

## Ideas

* Bluegrass/Folk: Reference Song: Death South, In Hell I'll be in Good Company
* 80ties Pop Synth: 
* Grunge: 
* 80ties PopRock: INXS
* Triphop: 
* Chanson:

#### Topic

My wife is a wonderful singer, but unfortunately she keeps her talent all for her self.
Recently we were joking about that and she told me that maybe if I ask her for singing with a song, she might consider to sing for me... so let's hope this works :-)

#### Lyrics

Verse
```
  G                             Em
I know you like singing in the car
     G                            Em
When you are on your own and I am far away
G                               Em
No one in the world should ever hear
    G                                    Em
The mighty words you're singing when you steer your way

Transition
    C                       Fmaj7
You keep your record in the shelf
    C                        D7
You keep your secret for yourself

Chorus
G                          A
Darling sing a song for me please
D                        G
I can't wait to hear you singing
G                          A
Darling sing a song for me please
D                        G
I can't wait to hear you singing
```

#### Rhythm and Harmonics

I just started to play the banjo, to keep it simple the song will be in G-Major. For the rhythm I have steady foot stamp and maybe a finger snip in mind. Becaus the song refers to my wife there should be something rolling in the rhythm, too (she loves that rolling dum-dum-digidigi pattern )

I start playing with these ideas on my guitar... and end up with cord progression from above
Because I don't want to forget the melody I recorded a first scratch with guitar in the iPhone.
Oh... 50 seconds without outro. Maybe 30 seconds are too ambitious?

#### Structure

The structure looks like this. 
1. Intro: Guitar, Bass and Drums, simple Banjo cords
2. Verse 
3. Transition
4. Chorus
5. Outuo: Banjo Solo, fade out


### 1. Production

1. I start with my template and add markers for the structure above to get a realistic overview of the timeline. I could just skip part of the verse and the transition to end up at 30 seconds, but it's a pity for that little song, so set my limit to max 60 seconds, everything below is a plus.
1. The major layout tells me that I can make it in 56 seconds with intro and outro.
