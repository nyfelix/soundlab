# 30 Seconds Challenge

This challenge is inspired by the "music production podcast" by Brian Funk. He is encouraging people to show up and get the work done until it's finished.

**Pick a genre and write a 30 seconds track in that gere every week**

The basic idea of this exercise is to go through the complete process of songwriting and production very quickly to build up experience and confidence. After each track I will do a short review and consider changes in my process or templates.
I also want to use the input form book "Music Production 2022+" by Tommy Swindali: He recommends to choose a reference track for each song.
It's not to goal to create great music this time, it's about learning and finishing with "good enough".

## Ideas

* Bluegrass/Folk: Reference Song: Death South, In Hell I'll be in Good Company
* 80ties Pop Synth: 
* Grunge: 
* 80ties PopRock: INXS
* Triphop: 
* Chanson:

#### Lyrics

Verse
I know you like singing in the car
When you are on your own and I am far away
No one in the world should ever hear
The mighty words you're singing when you steer your way

Transition
You keep your record in the shelf
You keep your secret for yourself

Chorus
Darling sing a song for me please
Darling sing a song for me please
I can't wait to hear you singing

#### Rhythm and Harmonics

I just started to play the banjo, to keep it simple the song will be in G-Major. For the rhythm I have steady foot stamp and maybe a finger snip in mind. Becaus the song refers to my wife there should be something rolling in the rhythm, too (she loves that rolling dum-digi-dum-digi pattern like in "this shoes are made for walking")

I start playing with these ideas on my guitar.
