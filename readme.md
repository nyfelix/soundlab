# Twelve SoundLab

This ist the root of SoundLab. It's the documentation of hardware and software, configuration, presets and most of all personal experience of my home recording studio. Currently, the full setup is based on commercial or open source software. Maybe in future my own plugins might go here, too.

This repo organizes:
- Documentation of the my personal workflow and experience for song writing and production 
- Templates for LogicPro X
- Channel strip presets
- Recording settings (and according experiments)

> This section will be continuously changing and point to what I'm currently working on:

After listening to the first 3 episodes of Brian Funk's () production podcast I got the inspiration to set myself a challenge to write "bad music" and still finish the production workflow.
Here's the challenge: Pick a genre and write a 30 second jam track every week.
Here are the details: (ProjectGenereJam.md)

Things to remember for this experiment:
* Use a reference track
* Update the workflow template after each project (protocol each step)
* Be strict: 1. Record, 2. Edit, 3. Mix
* Improve the "Monitoring Bus" concept during recording





## Live settings

### Additional Infrastructure
* Roland RC-300 Loop station
* Beringer X1204 Mixer (analog)
* Apple Main Stage
