# Backlog

Theses are things I pick up along the way and store here, so I don't forget it.

## Studio Upgrades

* Equipment for stereo miking
* Microphone isolation shields
* Reamp Box


## Things to test / open questions and answers

* Experiment with mic placement (near, far, room, mono, stereo)
* Further investigate if a ribbon mic would add value
* Map Komplete Kontrol (Knob icon) to AKAI MPK Mini (probably already works fine, maybe needs Controller Editor) and release the settings here
* Learn more about sampling with Komplete Kontrol
* 

## Things to remember

* Reamping / Mixed amping with Audient (correct setup in manual)


## Answered questions

Question: Do I really need a DI Box with the Audient? 
No, DI ist built into the audio interface, but I need a reamp-box (https://support.audient.com/hc/en-us/articles/12887532403220-How-do-I-re-amp-using-the-iD14-MKII-)
