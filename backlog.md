## Answered questions

Question: Do I really need a DI Box with the Audient? 
No, DI ist built into the audio interface, but I need a reamp-box (https://support.audient.com/hc/en-us/articles/12887532403220-How-do-I-re-amp-using-the-iD14-MKII-)

Question: What is a sampler really?
It's a synth that uses audio files for input (instead of an oscillator). From there you can change pitch and use filters and do all the crazy stuff you would do with a synth.
